Part 1: Patient Management (Linked List)
In this part of the project, we implemented patient management using a linked list.
Each node in the linked list represents a patient record containing details such as patient ID, name, and disease information.
Linked lists were useful because they allow dynamic insertion and deletion of patient records without shifting data. 
This helped us efficiently manage patient admissions and removals in the hospital system.

art 2: Appointment Scheduling (Priority Queue)

Appointment scheduling was implemented using a priority queue.
Patients were scheduled based on their priority level rather than arrival time. 
This ensured that emergency and high-priority patients were handled first.
Working on the priority queue helped me understand how priority-based scheduling works in real hospital systems.

Part 3: Billing System (Stack with Heap)

The billing system was implemented using a stack, and heap was used to manage billing-related tasks efficiently.
The stack followed the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, while the heap helped in organizing and processing billing data based on priority.
I mainly worked on the heap-based task execution logic, which improved my understanding of heap operations and data organization.
